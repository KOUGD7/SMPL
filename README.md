SMPL is a small, but expressive toy programming language. As the name suggests, SMPL is easy to learn but, as you will discover, it is quite powerful.

1.	Complie Lexer:
    jflex syntax/FnPlotLexer

2.	Compile Cup:
    cup -parser FnPlotParser syntax/FnPlotParser.cup

3.	COPY new parser.java generated by CUP to syntax package

4.	Compile Classes
    javac -classpath ".:/usr/share/java/cup.jar:/home/adminubuntu/Documents/fnplot-starter/src:/home/adminubuntu/Documents/fnplot-starter/src/fnplot/sys" sys/Repl.java

Note: the exceptions (.java) in sys folder	 may have to be compiled individually

5.	Run Compiled Class
    java -classpath ".:/usr/share/java/cup.jar:/home/adminubuntu/Documents/fnplot-starter/src:/home/adminubuntu/Documents/fnplot-starter/src/fnplot/sys" fnplot/sys/Repl
